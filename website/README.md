#Front end to show the data from the iframes of grafana

```TEXT
You can find all the code in the files index.HTML, style.css and solar.js.

I made a repository on Git hub of the front end and i just linked with Netlify. Then i changed the name of Netlify to https://solar-flower.netlÂ²ify.app

```

Why an front end ?

To make the project look more professional and clean.
